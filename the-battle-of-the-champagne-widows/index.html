Here is an article about the most famous champagne widows and a blind tasting of their non-vintage brut champagnes re-posted from the <a href="https://epicurealist.wordpress.com/">Epicurealist</a>.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p> Champagne is a unique wine. It comes from a region with a challenging climate, most often unsuitable for quality still wine, but through the development of the technique of sparkling winemaking it has managed to become a benchmark for its kind, an expensive item of luxury and an indication of style. This is impressive enough but there is something less known and obvious about champagne that fascinates me more. </p><p> Ever since I started to dig deeper into the world and history of the bubbly drink my attention has been drawn to the extent of involvement of women in the running of the champagne business and the key role they have played in the success of the industry and the companies they were in charge of. During my visits to the region of Champagne I learned that some of the most successful houses have at a certain period in their history been run by a widow who has inherited the business from her husband. By the way, being a widow was the only way for a woman to be independent and have her own business in France in the 19th century since the unmarried women were financially dependent on their fathers and the married ones depended on their husbands. So, these “grand dames”, as they are often called, used creativity, entrepreneurship, intuition and sheer ambition to turn around the business, making it profitable in hard times, expanding the operations and, in some cases, making innovations that nowadays contribute to the image of champagne as an unmistakable symbol of celebration and joie de vivre. Actually, I cannot think of any other area of winemaking or even a business in general whose history has been influenced to such an extent by women. </p><p> So, one day, in a blissful moment of champagne induced inspiration, I started thinking of a way to pay respect to the entrepreneurial and competitive spirit of the women of the champagne trade. It didn’t take too many glasses of sparkling wine before I came up with the idea to host a blind tasting of the champagnes produced by the most notable houses whose history and success have been shaped by one of those “grand dames”. Some sort of a battle among the widows to determine whose descendants produce the best champagne or, at least, the one that would be most appreciated by me and my friends. No sooner said than done! I negotiated a date with my wife who, apart from being my most faithful wine tasting companion, is an excellent cook. But we needed a bigger tasting panel, so she sent invitations to some friends who we thought might be interested. Since only 3 of them responded positively to the proposed date, we decided to go for half-bottles rather than postponing the event to accommodate the schedules of more people. Finally, I sourced from a couple of local stores the non-vintage brut champagnes of the 4 most famous brands associated with widows and threw in an “outsider” to make for a more diversified bunch. </p><p> Now is the time to make a brief interlude and introduce the 5 champagne houses that ended up in our blind tasting list. Here they are with a short description about the widow that stood behind each of them: </p><p> – Veuve Clicquot. Wenever someone thinks of a champagne widow, Barbe-Nicole Clicquot (or Veuve Clicquot) is the first one to spring to mind and rightly so – she is the first woman to head a champagne house and one of the iconic figures in the industry! Much to the shock of the conservative establishment she took the reins of the House of Clicquot when she was only 27 years old after the death of her husband in 1805 and in the next 50 years transformed not only the company but the whole champagne trade. With bold decisions and unprecedented vision she conquered the European market and was among the first champagne producers to take on Russia and the United States. She is also considered to be one of the most important innovators in the industry, inventing the rosé champagne, introducing the first champagne label and creating the modern champagne bottle. Most importantly, she invented the groundbreaking technique of riddling (or remuage) – the famous turning of the bottles at an angle to get rid of the sediment from the second fermentation that is still widely used today. In short, Veuve Clicquot was the first true female CEO in France that turned a small winemaking business into a global empire and changed a whole industry. </p><p> – Pommery. Louise Pommery was the next champagne widow to inherit the business of her husband when he died in 1860 by an unexplained cause. However, when she inherited the company, it was a struggling wool trading business with a few acres of champagne vineyards on the side, but under her leadership the firm focused exclusively on champagne production and soon became one of the region’s largest Champagne brands. Much like Veuve Clicquot she was an audacious manager responsible for a number of innovations that were beneficial to the success of the industry. Widow Pommery was among the first to purchase some of the ancient Roman limestone and chalk pits (the so-called crayères) carved beneath the city of Reims to use them as cellars for storing and aging her champagne – a very perceptive move soon followed by many other Champagne houses. She is also credited with the invention of the first brut champagne possibly as an answer to the demand for drier wines from the United Kingdom and a request for a less sweet variation of the drink from one of her most notable clients, Queen Victoria (another widow, by the way). </p><p> – Laurent-Perrier. Throughout its history, the house of Laurent-Perrier has had not one but three women in charge of its business. In 1882 the widowed Mathilde Perrier took control of the family company and added her name to the brand after the death of her husband Eugene Laurent. She led the company to great success and managed to avoid the disaster caused by the World War I in France by introducing and marketing the Laurent-Perrier champagne in the United Kingdom. In 1925 the business was inherited by Mathilde’s daughter Eugénie. She, in turn, sold the company in 1939 to Mary-Louise de Nonancourt, whose descendants still retain majority ownership of the house today. </p><p> – Bollinger. This champagne house has been singlehandedly brought to the international prominence it enjoys today by Elizabeth “Lilly” Bollinger, the last of the “grand dames”, who took over the management of the business after the death of her husband Jacques in 1941. Not only did she successfully lead the company through one of the toughest period for the champagne industry when World War II was raging across Europe, but she managed to significantly expand production through the purchase of more vineyards and for 30 years tirelessly traveled across the world to promote the brand. The result: presence and sales in more than 100 countries and James Bond’s favourite champagne! </p><p> – Veuve Fourny & Fils. This was the “outsider” which I accidentally came across in Zurich’s Markthalle Im Viadukt. The role of the widow in the history of this champagne turned out to be more obscure than in the four big houses already selected for the tasting – the business is currently run by two brothers who claim that they have learned it all from their mother Madame Veuve Fourny, the widow in question, but they mention also their grand father and “his son” as having influenced them. Nevertheless, we decided to include this champagne in the tasting as it was of very good quality and having more champagnes is always better than having less. It is also interesting to note that this is the only champagne in our selection graded as a “premier cru”. However, this is not necessarily an indication of superior quality per se because in Champagne, unlike in other French regions, cru grading is given to whole villages rather than specific vineyards and does not impose strict limitations in terms of yields which reduces its reliability. </p><picture>

<p> So, these were our contestants, the respectable “dames”. With all the 5 beauties in stock the only thing left to take care of was some nice food to pair with the champagne that would also help us clean our palates between the tastings. My wife stepped in devising and cooking an excellent menu for the occasion that included among other things: </p><p> – Jamon serrano with figs </p><p> – Blinis with sour cream and wild salmon roe (red caviar) </p><p> – Butter flutes and avocado mousse dip </p><p> – Gougères nature (simple pâte a choux pastries) </p><p> – Fresh oysters and oysters Rockefeller (an adapted version with spinach, and with Amontillado instead of Pernod) </p><p> – Smoked salmon parmentier </p><p> – Croque Monsieur in ramekin with optional green salad (lightly flavoured dressing) </p><p> On the day of the event our tasting panel consisted of five enthusiastic members, of which 2 men and 3 women. None of us was working professionally in the wine industry and thus a fair dose of fun was involved in the process. A simple cumulative 20 point system was devised to evaluate each champagne accounting for appearance (1-5 points), aroma (1-7 points) and taste (1-8 points) with the final result for each champaigne obtained by adding together the results of all panel participants. After one very long hour of looking, smelling, inhaling, swirling, sipping, swallowing and writing we finally came up with a winner. To me, the final result was somewhat unexpected but it was absolutely in line with the desire of everyone to have some sort of a twist, a tale with a surprise ending. When we finally uncovered the wrappings it turned out that the undisputed winner was actually our “outsider” and the two most prominent houses ended up at the bottom! The outcome of this Battle of the Widows looked as follows: </p><p> 1. Veuve Fourny & Fils (Grande Reserve Brut Premier Cru) – 88 points </p><p> 2. Laurent-Perrier (Brut) – 84 points </p><p> 3. Bollinger (Special Cuvee Brut) – 77 points </p><p> 4. Pommery (Brut Royal) – 75 points </p><p> 5. Veuve Clicquot (Brut) – 64 points </p><p> The result was met with a bout of excitement, mixed with surprise and cheering. After a brief discussion with a lot of “I knew it…” and “didn’t I tell you…” the culinary party was completed with a fine selection of cheeses, a Zurich chocolate truffle cake and fresh strawberries (the latter being quite a pleasant surprise considering we were in the middle of October) all brought by our guests and fellow members of the tasting panel. At the end everybody departed with a carefree smile and those sparkles in the eyes so typical of a champagne state of mind. We all seemed to agree that the project had to be repeated in order to test the consistency of the result, as if we needed an excuse to indulge in another bubbly extravaganza. Actually, I am sure that the exercise could be easily repeated even without a respectable cause. Mireille Guiliano, another famous woman in the industry and a former spokesperson and executive for Veuve Clicquot, has put it quite rightly: no occasion is too small for a champagne. Cheers to that! </p><p> —————- </p><p> PS: Here are some useful links related to this story: </p><p> The website of the winner of our blind tasting: http://www.champagne-veuve-fourny.com </p><p> An excellent guide to champagne tasting: http://www.champagne.fr/assets/files/carnets/carnet3en.pdf</p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="30"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="32"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="33"><span data-reactid="34"><!-- react-empty: 35 --><h2 data-reactid="36"><a data-reactid="37">The battle of the champagne widows</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="40"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="41"></div></section></div></div>

It didn’t take too many glasses of sparkling wine before I came up with the idea to host a blind tasting of the champagnes produced by the most notable houses whose history and success have been shaped by one of those “grand dames”. Some sort of a battle among the widows to determine whose descendants produce the best champagne or, at least, the one that would be most appreciated by me and my friends. No sooner said than done! I negotiated a date with my wife who, apart from being my most faithful wine tasting companion, is an excellent cook. But we needed a bigger tasting panel, so she sent invitations to some friends who we thought might be interested.
