**Champagne** is all about having a good time and you can't have a good time without (at least) a little bit of humour. So here's our first dose of champagne humour - a joke that has been around for some time, but we like it a lot, not least because of its international flavour.

A multi-national company held a reception to celebrate Christmas. The waiter gave each guest a glass of champagne, but on inspection, each guest noticed that their glass contained a fly.

• The Swede asked for new champagne in the same glass.  
• The Englishman demanded to have new champagne in a new glass.  
• The Finn picked out the fly out and drank the champagne.  
• The Russian drank the champagne, fly and all.  
• The Chinese ate the fly but left the champagne.  
• The Israeli caught the fly and sold it to the Chinese.  
• The Italian drank two thirds of the champagne and then demanded to have a new glass.  
• The Norwegian took the fly and went off to fish.  
• The Irishman ground the fly and mixed it in the champagne, which he then donated to the Englishman  
• The American sued the restaurant and claimed $50 million in compensation.  
• The Scotsman grabbed the fly by the throat and shouted, 'Now spit out all that you swallowed.'
